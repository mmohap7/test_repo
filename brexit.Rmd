## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(here)
```


```{r brexit}
brexit_results <- read_csv("brexit_results.csv")
glimpse(brexit_results) 
```

```{r}
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2.5) + labs(title="Leave Share in all constituencies")

ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_density()
```

```{r}
brexit_results %>% 
  select(leave_share, born_in_uk) %>% 
  cor()
```
```{r}
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = born_in_uk, y = leave_share)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of leave share corresponding to population born in different constituencies of UK") + labs(x="Born in UK", y="Leave Share")
```
What can you say about the relationship shown above? Again, don't just say what's happening in the graph. Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

> The scatterplot of leave share corresponding to the percentage of native born population in various constituencies, clearly depicts that a majority of scatter points are populating the higher end of of the graph (correponding to higher leave share or the population which voted yes). This indicates that a majority of the constituencies in UK have a native born population and these constituencies had a higher leave share when compared to constituencies with comparitively less native born population. ***A major reason could be that in constituencies with higher native born population preferred UK to have more control over its immigration policies and border***.
