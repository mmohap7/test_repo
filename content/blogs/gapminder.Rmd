## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r gapminder}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(gapminder)  # gapminder dataset
library(here)

```

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) # look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```
```{r}

country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "India") # just choosing Greece, as this is where I come from

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Asia")
```

```{r}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
 NULL 

plot1
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
